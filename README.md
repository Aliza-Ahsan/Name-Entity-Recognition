# Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Word2Vec and TensorFlow
## Overview
**This project implements Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a deep learning-based approach. The dataset is preprocessed, tokenized, and embedded using Word2Vec, followed by training a sequence model using TensorFlow.**

Dataset
We use the Entity Annotated Corpus dataset, specifically the ner_dataset.csv file. This dataset contains:

Sentence #: Identifies sentences in the dataset.

Word: Individual words in the sentences.

POS: Part-of-Speech tags.

Tag: Named Entity Recognition (NER) labels.
